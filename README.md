# Brixel Theme

### A theme for our website

This website theme is a html template that serves as a base for a new website for Brixel Hackerspace Hasselt. 

It's based upon the great "Bushwick" theme for Anchor CMS, but stripped down to just a html version with a couple of tweaks so we can use it together with our wiki.

### Rendered Markdown wiki content project

This theme is the next step in wouter's [PPPPP - or Plain Practical PHP Page Parser](https://github.com/Brixel/Plain-Practical-PHP-Page-Parser).

The goal is to create a website that takes it's content from a dedicated wiki page. 
The content on the wiki page is written between <no wiki>-tags and written in markdown rather than the usual markup.

PPPPP recognises the markdown sections and translates them to html. That html content is then placed inside this theme.
And thus is providing our space with a good looking (no wiki) front-page that is easy to edit (via wiki) without the need of a seperate CMS.
